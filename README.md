This is an entry-level project to improve my Java, MySQL and OOP skills. It's a simple bank account application that allows you to create 
a new account and login into it, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer money, view account details and view transaction history, and view account details.
All of these actions are saved on a MySQL database.

As I developed this project in just a weekend, I'm sure there are many things that can be improved, and I'll be working on them.
